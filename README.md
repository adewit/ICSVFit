#ICSVFit

Code needed to run SVFit on the grid - only works for Run 2 SVFit

As the total size of the input files is too large we can't send the svfit input files in the crab sandbox, so before using this the files need to be copied over to dcache (file_prefix specified in ICSVFit/SVFitTest/bin/SVFitTest.cpp)

More documentation to follow...
